        <h1>Project Inspiration</h1>
        <div>
          <h2>
            The inspiration for this project originated from a personal desire
            to push my boundaries in client-side functionalities and delve into
            the realm of modern web development technologies. As an aspiring
            software engineer, I was keen on exploring the capabilities of
            frameworks like React, alongside complementary tools such as
            Tailwind CSS and Supabase. The journey began with a curiosity to
            understand how these technologies could seamlessly integrate to
            create robust, interactive web applications. I envisioned a
            practical project that would not only challenge my technical skills
            but also serve as a tangible representation of my growth and
            proficiency in the field. Embarking on this project wasn't merely a
            requirement from ALX Software Engineering Program; it was an
            opportunity for self-discovery and skill enhancement. The timeline
            for the project spanned several weeks, during which I dedicated
            countless hours to research, experimentation, and development, with
            the ultimate goal of delivering a polished and functional
            application.
